Instructions for building the Flutter XD plugin using nodejs and yarn.
=======================================================================

Steps:
* One time: Install nodejs (https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and yarn (npm i yarn -g)
* Open terminal and navigate to the /xd-flutter-plugin-src folder
* run `yarn`
* run `yarn build` 
* Plugin files will be copied into the /build folder, and also into your XD plugin developer folder 
* Refresh plugin in XD with `Ctrl+Shift+R`

Notes:
* If you get errors about missing dependencies when building, you probably need to run `yarn` again

Extras: 
* builds are run in watch mode by default, meaning webpack re-bundles on file save
  -> add `--no-watch` to disable watch mode
* all builds are automatically available in the XD develop folder
* add `--production` for minified builds, also disables sourcemaps
* You can debug the source with Chrome, instructions here https://adobexdplatform.com/plugin-docs/tutorials/debugging/
  -> The plugin path is wrong in step 2, use this command instead `CheckNetIsolation LoopbackExempt -is -n="Adobe.CC.XD_adky2gkssdxte"`
